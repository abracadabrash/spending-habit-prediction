# Logistic Regression Analysis of Spending Habits Based on Character Traits

This project explores spending behavior using logistic regression, analyzing how various character traits influence spending behaviors. Multiple models were tested, and the final model was selected based on AIC and relevance to the research question.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

- **Project Overview** â€“ A detailed explanation of the methodology, model selection, and findings.
- **Code & Analysis** â€“ The full code implementation, including data processing, model building, and visualization.

## ðŸ“¦ Packages Used

This analysis was conducted in **RStudio** using the following R packages:

- **tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)** â€“ Data manipulation and visualization
- **mosaic** â€“ Statistical summaries and model evaluation
- **broom** â€“ Model tidying and interpretation
- **RColorBrewer** â€“ Color palettes for visualizations
- **knitr** â€“ Report generation and table formatting

## ðŸ“Š Model Selection

Four logistic regression models were tested, with **Model 3** chosen as the final model. This model best captured the research question while maintaining credibility based on AIC and predictor significance.
